# sql-challenge

I did some peer to peer with Ethan another student on the starting portions of quickdb and the ERD, he also gave me logic pointers throughout the assignment. I used different AI to get help on debugging. I was not able to figure out where my query .sql went, but I can't find it so I'm not too sure where to re insert it after I remade it.
